# password_program
This is some simple code I wrote to create a user ID and password, and then only allow access with the correct information. I had learned the basics of how to do some of this from Zero To Mastery Academy's Complete Python for 2021 course and Learn Python 3 the Hard Way, but this code here was not from either course. This was me writing code from the top of my head, making sure I understood the concepts.

I also took care to make sure the content the user sees is properly written, punctuated, and laid out in a way that is easy to understand and use. After all, I am also a copy editor, and have layout and design experience. Of course, the biggest priority is making sure the code works, but I believe it's important to think of the user experience, making sure things look good and are accessible.
